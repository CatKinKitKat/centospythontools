# centospythontools

This work needs to be finished by 23h55 of May, 21th... So, quality parameters that wont be evaluated like KISS, DRY and etc. will be ignored like no one's business. I need to test these on a GNS3 emulated network with two CentOS 7 Servers and two clients, (one Linux and one Windows), plus I have yet to finish the report of this assigment.
